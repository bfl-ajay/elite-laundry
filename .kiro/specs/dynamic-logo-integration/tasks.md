  - Wrap the existing providers with BusinessSettingsProvider in App.jsx
  - Ensure proper provider hierarchy and context availability
  - Test that business settings are loaded on app initialization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 2. Create BusinessLogo component with fallback logic
  - Create new BusinessLogo component in components/common/
  - Implement image loading with error handling and fallback to default icon
  - Add proper responsive sizing and accessibility attributes
  - Include loading state handling and smooth transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 3. Update Navigation component to use dynamic logo
  - Replace hardcoded DashboardIllustration with BusinessLogo component
  - Integrate useBusinessSettings hook to consume logo data
  - Maintain existing responsive behavior for mobile and desktop
  - Ensure proper fallback when no logo is available
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement real-time logo updates in BusinessSettingsPage
  - Update BusinessSettingsPage to call context updateSettings on logo changes

  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Create unit tests for BusinessLogo component
  - Test component rendering with various props and states
  - Test error handling and fallback scenarios
  - Test responsive behavior and accessibility features
  - Test loading states and transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 7. Create integration tests for logo functionality
  - Test logo updates propagating from settings to navigation
  - Test application behavior with and without uploaded logos
  - Test context provider integration and state management
  - Test real-time updates across component tree
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

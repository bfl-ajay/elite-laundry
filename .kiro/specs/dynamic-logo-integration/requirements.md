# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the super admin uploaded business logo into the application's navigation header, replacing the current hardcoded dashboard icon with the dynamically uploaded logo. The system should gracefully handle cases where no logo is uploaded and provide appropriate fallbacks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want to see the business logo that was uploaded by the super admin in the navigation header, so that the application reflects the proper business branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super admin has uploaded a business logo THEN the navigation header SHALL display the uploaded logo instead of the hardcoded dashboard icon
2. WHEN no business logo has been uploaded THEN the navigation header SHALL display the default dashboard icon as fallback
3. WHEN the business logo fails to load THEN the navigation header SHALL gracefully fallback to the default dashboard icon
4. WHEN the business logo is updated by the super admin THEN the navigation header SHALL automatically reflect the new logo without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want the logo I upload to be immediately visible across the application, so that I can see the branding changes take effect in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super admin uploads a new logo THEN the navigation header SHALL update to show the new logo immediately
2. WHEN a super admin removes the current logo THEN the navigation header SHALL revert to the default icon immediately
3. WHEN multiple users are using the application simultaneously THEN all users SHALL see the updated logo without needing to refresh their browsers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logo integration to be performant and not impact application loading times, so that the user experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the business settings (including logo) SHALL be fetched efficiently without blocking the initial render
2. WHEN the logo image fails to load THEN the fallback SHALL be displayed without causing layout shifts
3. WHEN the logo is large THEN it SHALL be properly sized and optimized for the navigation header display
4. WHEN the business settings are loading THEN the navigation SHALL show the default icon until the logo is available

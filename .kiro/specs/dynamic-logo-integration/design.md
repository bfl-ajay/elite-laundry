# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements dynamic logo integration in the application navigation by leveraging the existing BusinessSettingsContext and updating the Navigation component to consume business settings. The solution ensures optimal performance, graceful fallbacks, and real-time updates across all user sessions.

## Architecture

### Context Integration
- Integrate `BusinessSettingsProvider` into the main App component to make business settings available globally
- The provider will fetch business settings on app initialization using the public settings endpoint
- Settings will be cached in context state and updated when changes occur

### Navigation Component Updates
- Update Navigation component to consume business settings from context
- Replace hardcoded DashboardIllustration with dynamic logo rendering
- Implement fallback logic for missing or failed logo loads
- Maintain responsive design for both desktop and mobile views

### Real-time Updates
- Leverage existing context update mechanism to propagate logo changes
- Business settings page will update context when logo changes occur
- All components consuming the context will automatically re-render with new logo

## Components and Interfaces

### BusinessSettingsProvider Integration
```jsx
// App.jsx structure
<BusinessSettingsProvider>
  <AuthProvider>
    <Router>
      <AppContent />
    </Router>
  </AuthProvider>
</BusinessSettingsProvider>
```

### Navigation Component Interface
```jsx
const Navigation = () => {
  const { settings, loading } = useBusinessSettings();
  
  // Logo rendering logic with fallbacks
  const renderLogo = () => {
    if (loading || !settings?.logoUrl) {
      return <DashboardIllustration />; // Fallback
    }
    
    return (
      <img 
        src={settings.logoUrl} 
        alt={settings.businessName || 'Business Logo'}
        onError={handleImageError}
      />
    );
  };
};
```

### Logo Component Design
- Create a dedicated `BusinessLogo` component for reusability
- Handle image loading states and error scenarios
- Implement proper sizing and responsive behavior
- Support both light and dark themes if applicable

## Data Models

### Business Settings Context State
```javascript
{
  settings: {
    id: number,
    businessName: string,
    logoUrl: string | null,
    faviconUrl: string | null,
    hasLogo: boolean,
    hasFavicon: boolean
  },
  loading: boolean,
  error: string | null,
  loadSettings: () => Promise<void>,
  updateSettings: (settings) => void
}
```

### Logo Display Properties
```javascript
{
  src: string,
  alt: string,
  className: string,
  fallbackIcon: ReactComponent,
  onError: () => void,
  loading: boolean
}
```

## Error Handling

### Image Loading Failures
- Implement `onError` handler for logo images
- Gracefully fallback to default dashboard icon
- Log errors for debugging without breaking user experience
- Prevent infinite loading states

### Network Failures
- Handle business settings API failures gracefully
- Show default branding when settings cannot be loaded
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Cache settings in localStorage for offline scenarios

### Context Errors
- Wrap BusinessSettingsProvider with error boundaries
- Provide meaningful error messages for development
- Ensure application continues to function without business settings

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test BusinessLogo component with various props and states
- Test Navigation component logo rendering logic
- Test context provider state management and updates
- Test error handling and fallback scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Test logo updates propagating from settings page to navigation
- Test application behavior with and without uploaded logos
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Test image loading performance and error scenarios

### E2E Tests
- Test complete logo upload and display workflow
- Test logo removal and fallback behavior
- Test real-time updates across multiple browser sessions
- Test application loading with slow network conditions

## Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization
- Implement proper image sizing for navigation display
- Use responsive images for different screen densities
- Consider lazy loading for non-critical logo displays
- Implement image caching strategies

### Context Optimization
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders using React.memo
- Implement selective context updates to avoid cascading renders
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
- Consider context splitting if business settings grow large

### Loading States
- Show skeleton or placeholder during initial load
- Implement smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
- Avoid layout shifts when logo loads
- Provide immediate feedback for logo changes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Context Integration
1. Integrate BusinessSettingsProvider into App.jsx
2. Update context to use public settings endpoint
3. Test context functionality and error handling

### Phase 2: Logo Component
1. Create BusinessLogo component with fallback logic
2. Implement responsive sizing and error handling
3. Add proper accessibility attributes and alt text

### Phase 3: Navigation Updates
1. Update Navigation component to use BusinessLogo
2. Replace hardcoded icons with dynamic logo rendering
3. Test responsive behavior and mobile compatibility

### Phase 4: Real-time Updates
1. Ensure settings page updates propagate to navigation
2. Test logo changes across multiple user sessions
3. Implement proper cache invalidation strategies

### Phase 5: Testing and Polish
1. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Optimize performance and loading states
3. Add error monitoring and logging
4. Document usage and maintenance procedures

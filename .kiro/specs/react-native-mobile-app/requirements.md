# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a React Native mobile application for Android that provides access to the Elite Laundry Management System through a WebView interface. The mobile app will serve as a native wrapper around the existing web frontend, enabling mobile users to access all laundry management features through their Android devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a laundry business user, I want to access the laundry management system on my Android device, so that I can manage orders and operations while being mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the mobile app THEN the system SHALL display the web frontend in a full-screen WebView
2. WHEN the user interacts with the WebView THEN the system SHALL provide native-like navigation and user experience
3. WHEN the user rotates the device THEN the system SHALL maintain the current state and adapt to the new orientation
4. WHEN the user minimizes and reopens the app THEN the system SHALL restore the previous session state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to handle network connectivity gracefully, so that I can work offline when possible and get appropriate feedback when connectivity is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device has no internet connection THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate offline message
2. WHEN the connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically reload the WebView content
3. WHEN the WebView fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a retry mechanism
4. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to provide native Android features and integrations, so that I have a seamless mobile experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a native splash screen with the Elite Laundry branding
2. WHEN the user navigates within the WebView THEN the system SHALL handle back button navigation appropriately
3. WHEN the user receives notifications THEN the system SHALL support push notifications for order updates
4. WHEN the user needs to share content THEN the system SHALL provide native sharing capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the mobile app to be configurable and maintainable, so that I can update the web URL and app settings without rebuilding the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web frontend URL changes THEN the system SHALL allow configuration updates through app settings
2. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide development tools and logging capabilities
3. WHEN the app needs updates THEN the system SHALL support over-the-air updates for configuration
4. WHEN security is required THEN the system SHALL implement proper SSL certificate validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to provide optimal performance and user experience, so that I can work efficiently on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on average devices
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and animations
3. WHEN using touch interactions THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to gestures and touch events
4. WHEN the device has limited resources THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the mobile app to maintain security and authentication, so that sensitive business data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL securely store authentication credentials
2. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures
3. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use secure communication protocols
4. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile app to be built with modern React Native practices, so that it's maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable React Native version
2. WHEN structuring the code THEN the system SHALL follow React Native best practices and conventions
3. WHEN handling state THEN the system SHALL implement proper state management patterns
4. WHEN testing the app THEN the system SHALL include unit tests and integration tests
